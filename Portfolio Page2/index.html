    <h2>1.Bio</h2>
    <p><mark>
      I was born in Orlando. When I was three years old,
      <br>I moved to Japan and lived there for 15 years. So, my first language
      <br>is Japanese. In Japan, we need to take exams to enroll in universities.
      <br>The exams are so severe that many people cannot pass them and those
      <br>who did not pass them need to decide whether they continue studying for
      <br>next year's exams or go to their second-choice universities. Having studied
      <br>for five years in Japanese middle and high schools for university entrance exams
      <br>and having close friends in Japan, deciding whether to come to America or stay
      <br>in Japan was a very serious decision for me, but I decided to come here because
      <br>my parents stay here for their work.</mark>

      When I was in Japan, I took a piano lesson for a year, a kimono lesson for
      <br>a year, calligraphy lesson for two years, a swimming lesson for six years, and
      <br>tea ceremony lesson for ten years and went to cram school for six years <br>to pass entrance exams for middle school and universities.</mark>
